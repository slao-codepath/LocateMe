========

LocateMe is a real-time location based meetup organizer for your friends.  It lets you create a meetup, invite friends to join the meetup, and monitor your friends' location and ETA in realtime.

The user flow is described below (and in our wireframes):

1.  Log in
2.  View list of meetups and invitations
         - Mark meetup as Pending, Active, Declined, Arrived, or Canceled
         - Delete any meetups from list
3.  View 'Active' meetup status on list view or map view
         - Optionally edit your current transportation mode and route
         - List view shows everyone's mode of transportation and ETA
         - Map view shows everyone's current location, and clicking their icon on the map shows mode of transportation and ETA (this is an optional feature)
4.  Create new meetup
         - Select name, time, location by map/address/saved, and friends to invite
